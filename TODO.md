# V1 Tasks

[ ] some sort of tests for JS parts
[ ] v2 state machine construction
  - probably want some sort of macro that compiles down to existing version but lets you define states explicitly
    * this does allow for isolated states w/out transitions so should check for that in the macro itself
[ ] shortcut for key down, up types so you could do like :e-down (should allow for codes too)

# Public Release Tasks

[ ] README quick start
[ ] more examples (crib from Zelkova)
[ ] introductory tutorial
[ ] landing page
